Greetings fellow lurker of non-directed page content!
As you can see, there is much content available, that is not on the page.
and as a bonus easter-egg, you get to see the "toilet" picture, and hear the backstory.

When I first moved into the woods, I used to have an outhouse, where the bucket in the picture was placed.
I also had a porclain toilet, but just keept delaying it's instalment.
Mostly because diging down a septic tank is alot of work(my pre excavator days).
However, when the first night of frost hit, the toilet was imidiatly instaled,
but with no septic tank in the ground, this was the temperary solution.
Thank you for listening to my crap-talk.
