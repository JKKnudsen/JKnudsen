    <h1>Wimshurst Machine</h1>

    

    <p>Back in 2013 I got really into classical electrostatic generators. </p>
    <p>There is something so appealing about a hand-cranked high-voltage source.</p>
	<p>As well as the early instrumentation, like the gold-leaf electroscope.</p>
	<p>All of wich can be made from items at a hardware-store.</p>
	<p>That was also where I got the poly-carbonate we see here.</p>
	<img src="059.png" alt="Failed to Load" style="width:200px;height:auto;padding:5px;">
	<p>It was cut with a 3D-printed circle cutting jig.(Had just made my first 3d printer)</p>
	<p>In v.1 of the Wimshurst machine, I just wanted to se if I could get it working. </p>
	<p>And so, was just cobbled together with bits laying around.</p>

     <source src="Wimshurst2.mp4" type="video/mp4">

	 </video>
	<p>Foil-tape for the charge carrying-plates, PVC-tubing for the belt drives.</p>
	<p>For the capasitors I just used some PVC pipes, lined inside and out with foil tape.</p>

	<p>The brushes where made from solder-wick, and the combs from copper wire,</p>
	<p>sharpened to a point, and soldered to the cover plate.</p>
	<p>Most of the parts from v.1 was reused in v.2. </p>
	<img src="032.jpg" alt="Failed to Load" style="width:640px;height:auto;padding:5px;">
	<p>Now obviously I don't have video of v.2 in use. It was donated to the Physics pub</p>
	<p>at UiB, but I belive someone took it. The only thing I know for certain,</p>
	<p>is that I have no idea where it is.</p>
	<p>Before i donated it, I did use it for some cool things.</p>
	<p>It could drive an x-ray tube. As well as my home-made CO2-laser tube, at least</p>
	<p>the two pulses the tube lasted.</p>
	<p>I would love to make another wimshurst machine, but this time it's go BIG or go home.</p>
	<p>I have my eye set on those round, 1m diameter, glass patio-tables.</p>
	<p>When a matching pair has been found in the giva-away section, </p>
	<p>it's time for v.3.</p>
