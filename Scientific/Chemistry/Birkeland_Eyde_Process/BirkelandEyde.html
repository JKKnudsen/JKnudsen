    <h1>Out of thin Air</h1>

	<p>Back in 2012 there where uncertainties of how available nitrates would be to the armature chemist.</p>
	<p>For reasons, potassium-nitrate was no longer over the counter, would calsium-nitrate go next?</p>
	<p>How are you going to coat "all the things!" in silver without nitric acid to make your silver nitrate</p>
	<p>Luckly Henry Cavendish made in 1784 the observation, that a high voltage discharge would sometimes</p>
	<p>produce nitric oxide. Further developments in arch controll was made by Julius Pl√ºcker.</p>
	<p>But the inducrial process we know today, was developed by Kristian Birkeland and Sam Eyde.</p>
	<p>The process in itself is rather simple. The air around us contain both Oxygen and Nitrogen</p>
	<p>When we talk about a nitrate we refere to NO3-, nitric acid would be HNO3.</p>
	<p>As you can see the air around us is almost a nitrate by itself. </p>
	<p>If only there was a way to make the diatomic N2 gas, loosen that pesky triple bond.</p>
	<p>Well, as it turns out, about 5kV and 3000C will do the trick.</p>
	<p>Under these conditions diatomic Nitrogen  splits, and is free to react with Oxygen.</p>
	<p>Forming Nitric Oxide. The Nitric Oxide quickly reacts with more oxygen,</p>
	<p>and forms Nitrogen DiOxide, NO2.</p>
	<p>The NO2 is then bubbled through water, forming nitric acid, HNO3.</p>
	<br>
	<p>This is the process, but in my first attempt I used a 555 based fly-back as</p>
	<p>a high voltage source. This failed to deliver the necessary temperatures,</p>
	<p>and didn't give any change to the pH of the reciver.</p>

	<p>Round two, the 555, was swaped for a ZVS. These will dump alot more power into your</p>
	<p>flyback, but it also like to push the magic smoke out of the driving transistors,</p>
	<p>and is a firm beliver in short working hours.</p>

	<p>This time around, ther was some positive results, the pH was clearly indicating</p>
	<p>that it was highly acidic. But titration reveiled a rather abysmal amount of HNO3.</p>
	<img src="pH.jpg" alt="Failed to Load" style="height:160px;width:auto;padding:5px;">
	<p>And this was the point where I actuall did the calculation, to see how much I should expect.</p>
	<p>And got a sharp reminder why you always do the calculations first, and don't skim past</p>
	<p>the section of a paper that deals with the power requirements.. </p>
	<p>30g of HNO3 per kWh is the industrial standard, at home it's more like 3g/kWh.</p>
    <p>Luckly Ca(NO3)2 never went out of sale.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Still there is a part of me that would like to be self-sufficient nitrate wise,</p>
	<p>And some preliminary experiments, based around a little known process that predates </p>
	<p>Birkeland-Eyde has yielded some "peaty" neat results. More to come!</p>
